# Japanese-Honorific-Classifier
As a foreign student in Japan, we are compelled to encounter various unfamiliar situation and are asked to speak appropriate 
Japanese in terms of the environment. It is a tough task for foreigners to differentiate between normal Japanese and Proper 
Japanese. There are Honorifics in Japanese, and it turns out to be confusing for foreigners whose mother language does not 
contain such forms.

This classifier aims to help foreigners in Japan understand the form of Japanese that they are using to cope with issues under different situation.
To be more specific, there is a numbers of proper forms in Japanese Keigo (敬
語), such as Kenjyougo (謙譲語)、Sonkeigo (尊敬語)、Bikago (美化語)、Teineigo (丁寧語). These are all honorifics, so 
called proper Japanese, but they are asked to be used only under certain conditions.
